# Project solution.

This repository contains my solutions to the Project 2019 for the module Programming for Data Analysis at GMIT.

[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/brianmcgmit/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Project.pdf)

## My simulation.

The main task in this project was to create a synthesised data set. I created a Jupyter notebook, where I created a dataset by simulating a real-world phenomenon using numpy.random package in Python. The tasks in this project:

* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## How to download the repository.

1. Go to [Github](https://github.com/amacuga/progda-project).
2. Click the "Clone or download" button.
3. Select "Download ZIP".

## How to run my jupyter notebook.

1. Make sure you have Python installed- I would recommend installing the free version of Anaconda.
2. Unzip the repository folder.
2. Run cmder or similar tool.
3. In cmder, navigate to the unzipped folder.
4. Run "jupyter notebook".
5. Select "Project.ipynb".
