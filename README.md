# Project solution.
This repository contains my solutions to the Project 2019 for the module Programming for Data Analysis at GMIT.

## My simulation 

The main task in this project was to create a synthesised data set. I created a Jupyter notebook, where I created a dataset by simulating a real-world phenomenon using numpy.random package in Python. The tasks in this project:

* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
